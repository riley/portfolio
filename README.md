# Riley Davis portfolio site

## Overview

[rileydav.is](http://rileydav.is) is my personal portfolio site/blog. This is the 2015 update -- I haven't touched my personal site since I left DXD and moved from Kansas City more than 5 years ago.

start the app with `gulp serve`

## Setup

I wanted to try Google's Web Starter Kit, since it seems like you have to spend some time unwinding Bootstrap's styles unless you want to be stuck with them for longer than most apps live.

## Structure

- `index.html` - Home page
- `about.html`
- `blog.html` - This is the real question mark. Phase II is probably just going to be creating some templates and build/publishing them instead of having a whole database just for a few blog posts. Jekyll would be the first choice, but wsk aleady has gulp and node, so I'll just use Jade and build them from time to time.
